          <h2 id="intro">Introduction to the Study</h2>
          <p>My name is Fan Zhang, a psychologist who is doing a PhD research project at University of Roehampton. Here is a link to my professional page: <a href="https://roehampton.academia.edu/FanZhang">https://roehampton.academia.edu/FanZhang</a>.</p>
          <p>My research is titled “Assessing Childhood Trauma with Narrative Stems: An attachment and physiological approach”. It looks at whether an assessment tool, called Narrative Stems, is useful in children who unfortunately have gone through some very difficult events. To do this, we need information from healthy children in the community so we could compare with children who need help. By taking part, you and your family will be helping us understand their difficulties and find a way to help them. You can get something useful out of this too: Narrative Stems is a good way to understand how your child relates to the important people in their lives. It will tell you how they balance reasoning and feelings when there are difficult things to deal with.
</p>
          <p>If your child is between 3 and 8 years of age, living with at least one parent, and your family is not currently working with Social Services, we need your help. Please take a look at the things we will be doing in this study in the <strong>In Detail</strong> section below.</p>
          <h2 id="detail">In Detail</h2>
          <h3>Narrative stems</h3>

          </figure>
          <p>A trained interviewer (in most cases, me) will sit with your child and tell some stories with toy house and dolls. The stories will be about normal day-to-day situations, such as cooking together, going to sleep and parents going on holidays. I will start off a story and ask your child to help me finish it. The stories will be video recorded, and sent to 2 experts to look at. The results will be discussed with you at a time that suits you.</p>
          <h3>Questionnaires</h3>

          <p>I’d also like to see how well your child understands the speech they hear. So there will be a short language test. I will say some words or sentences and ask your child to point at the right picture. As a parent, you will also need to fill out two questionnaires: one asking about the general life so far, another is a trauma symptom checklist. We use the checklist to compare with children from more difficult backgrounds.</p>

          <h3>Optional things I am also interested in</h3>
          <p>There are another couple things giving me more information. They are only optional. If you and your child would like to do them too, it will be great help. If not, you can still take part.</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/optional.jpg" alt="">
          </figure>
          <p>This is a heart rate monitor. I would like to use it to find out whether some topics make the heart beat a bit faster or slower. It is the size of two £1 coins and is put on either with a belt or two sticky pads in the photo. I will ask your help to put it on to make sure your child is comfortable.
</p>
          <p>This is a cotton stick made to take in some saliva. It is specially designed to be safe and tasteless for children. I will ask your child to put one end under their tongue for a minute and half, before putting it in a tube shown here. This will happen five times when we are doing Narrative Stems. You will need to take another five throughout a different day. I will drop by to collect them soon after.
</p>
          <p>If you would like to take part, contact me by <a href="mailto:zhangf@roehampton.ac.uk">zhangf@roehampton.ac.uk</a>.
</p>
          <h2 id="ethics">Safety and ethics</h2>
          <p>University of Roehampton Research Ethics Board has been given details of this study and given their approval. I have worked with children and vulnerable adults, and have been DBS checked to work with these people.
</p>
          <p>During the study, you can decide to stop at any time. If you change your mind after the study, you could ask for all information about your child to be destroyed. If your child shows discomfort or upset, we will be able stop straightaway to make sure your child is safe.
</p>
          <p>The only people who will see the information are my supervisors and the two experts of Narrative Stems. They are also DBS checked and will not share the information with anyone else.
